"""Answer guards: structural checks on a finished turn. Stdlib only.

These exist because prompt rules do not reliably constrain smaller models. Two
failure modes were observed repeatedly and are handled here as mechanism:

  - the turn ENDS with "I will call get_account_balance" and no call is made,
    leaving the user with an intention instead of an answer;
  - a compliance verdict ("within policy") is asserted without having
    retrieved BOTH the rule text and the actual figure.
